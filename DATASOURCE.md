We love data and believe that if someone took the time to record something that data has value. That being said not every data is appropreate for this project.

For incorporation into this project a dataset needs to have:

1) Soil carbon stocks [mass volume-1] quantified, preferably bulk density [mass volume-1] and organic carbon percentage [mass mass-1]. Any gap-filling needs to be clearly identified.
2) A public archive-level DOI or permanent URL guarantee for at least 10 years

Datasets will be prioritized based on:

1) Large number of sites (latitude-longitude-depth-time) characterized
2) Data that are currently of interest to contributors working on meta-analysis
3) Data with permissive reuse policy
