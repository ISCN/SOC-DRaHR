In each of the PVC mesocosms, we cut two 10.5 9 8 cm rectangular openings into the sides and cov- ered these openings and the circular bottom of the PVC mesocosm with 1.45 mm, 55 or 5 lm stainless steel mesh to allow root and mycorrhizal access, exclude roots or exclude roots and mycorrhizas, respectively"

After 20 min, we extracted four 15-mL gas samples over a period of 10 min from each mesocosm using a syringe and needle. We also collected four site-level samples of ambient air to measure the ambient 13C in the background atmospheric CO2. The four 13CO2 samples collected from each core and the average 13CO2 background measurement were used to con- struct a Keeling plot. The Keeling plot enabled us to calculate the @13C of the source of the carbon substrates metabolized by the soil microbial community (Pataki, Bowling & Ehleringer 2003). "
